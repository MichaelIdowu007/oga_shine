I interpret the “Roadside shoe repairs” as a valuable service or system that operates daily, but has remained invisible because it lacks a formal structure and a clear name. It is the hidden job to be done enveloped within a common, informal activity.
OGA-SHINE: On-The-Go Shoe Fixing Service

## Product Overview

OGA-SHINE is a Product Management concept that formalizes, brands, and packages the common, yet unstructured, activity of roadside shoe repair into a proactive, predictable, and reliable "On-The-Spot Shoe Rescue Service."

## What does the product do?

OGA-SHINE transforms the informal, uncertain activity of street-side shoe mending into a reliable, structured, and branded service. It does this by deploying uniformed service providers equipped with professional tools and a standardized menu of services to high-traffic areas in Nigeria.

It serves as an immediate, on-the-go solution for footwear maintenance and emergencies.

## Why does it matter? (It's Value Proposition)

OGA-SHINE directly addresses the high stress and unpredictability associated with Damaged Shoe Emergencies.
Unexpected incidents like broken heels, severe mud splatters, or scuff marks that occur moments before an important meeting or event.
