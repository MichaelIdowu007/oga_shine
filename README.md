I interpret the “Roadside shoe repairs” as a valuable service or system that operates daily, but has remained invisible because it lacks a formal structure and a clear name. It is the hidden job to be done enveloped within a common, informal activity.
OGA-SHINE: On-The-Go Shoe Fixing Service

## Product Overview

OGA-SHINE is a Product Management concept that formalizes, brands, and packages the common, yet unstructured, activity of roadside shoe repair into a proactive, predictable, and reliable "On-The-Spot Shoe Rescue Service."

## What does the product do?

OGA-SHINE transforms the informal, uncertain activity of street-side shoe mending into a reliable, structured, and branded service. It does this by deploying uniformed service providers equipped with professional tools and a standardized menu of services to high-traffic areas in Nigeria.

It serves as an immediate, on-the-go solution for footwear maintenance and emergencies.
